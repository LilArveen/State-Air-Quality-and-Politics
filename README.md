# State-Air-Quality-and-Politics

Data analysis of each state's air quality, and how it relates to it's political leanings. Western states were more polluted, but that can be attributed to the fact that there are more wildfires, which leads to more air pollution.
While there was some correlation between air quality and state political leanings, it was not enough to be considered statistically significant.

Utilized plotly for certain graphs when exploring each state's air quality. Plotly plots do not render on github. 

Since plotly graphs do not render on github (for now), one solution is to download the html file that was converted from the jupyter notebook and open that html file. That html file is included in this github repository.

Another solution is to use the link below to view the jupyter notebook with the plotly graphs:
